--- ANSI 16-color table derived from the palette. Used by `:terminal` and by the
--- ghostty/kitty extras, so the editor and the terminal always match.
--- ANSI magenta uses the violet keyword accent.
---
--- Both variants use the same roles: "black" (0) is a shade of the background
--- and "white" (7, 15) is the text color. Most TUIs are designed for dark
--- terminals: they draw borders and titles in white and put black text on a
--- colored highlight (lazysql, htop, tview/tcell apps). Mapping white to the
--- background in light mode made those borders vanish and left dark text on
--- dark highlights.
